	'Sometimes it is difficult to tell which movies are worth seeing at a film festival since they have never been seen before. In 2019, TIFF decided to allow attendees to "heart" the films they wished to see. I decided to use this as a metric for "popularity" so I could better decide which films were worth attending.'

# TIFF-2019

Movie_Grabber.py extracts film information from https://2019.tiffr.com using `bs4` to build the variables 'Title', 'Director', 'Category', 'Link', and the metric 'Heart' to gauge the popularity of the title. A comma separated file 'movies.csv' is exported which can then be explored in any spreadsheet software.

'Text_Notification.py' takes a list of films and sends a text message using `twilio` when tickets become available for the title.

### Spreadsheet Sample

{/* <div style={{'text-align': 'center'}}> */}
<div>
	![Top 20 Films](/images/tiff-scraper/table_screenshot.png)
</div>
{/* <div style={{margin: '0rem 2.5rem'}}>
	<Image
		src={ '/images/tiff-scraper/table_screenshot.png' }
		alt='app'


	/>
</div> */}

Without this application, I would not have bought tickets for Jojo Rabbit, Knives Out, Parasite or The Lighthouse, which turned out to be great films at the festival.
